# Madhya Pradesh District-wise Rainfall Analysis (2011-2014)

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from the Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India: [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/).  
It contains district-wise yearly rainfall data for Madhya Pradesh from 2011 to 2014, including long-term normal rainfall and actual rainfall for each year.

## Description
This project analyzes the district-wise rainfall patterns in Madhya Pradesh between 2011 and 2014. The data encompasses:
- Long Term Normal Rainfall (LTNR) values per district
- Actual rainfall recorded per district for each year from 2011 to 2014
- Percentage deviation of actual rainfall from LTNR for each year

The analysis performed includes plotting:
- Scatter plot between LTNR and Actual Rainfall to observe correlation and deviations
- Box plot showing the distribution and variability of actual rainfall across the four years
- Bar plot representing average rainfall per year across all districts
- Line plot illustrating rainfall trends for selected districts over the years

## Observations
- **Scatter plot (LTNR vs Actual Rainfall 2013):**  
  There is a positive correlation indicating districts with higher LTNR generally have higher actual rainfall in 2013, though several districts show significant departuresâ€”some with much above or below expected rainfall suggesting localized climate variability.

- **Box plot (Actual Rainfall 2011-2014):**  
  Displays the spread and median rainfall values year-wise. Years 2013 and 2011 show higher medians and greater range, indicating more variability and wetter conditions. Year 2014 exhibited lower median rainfall and tighter distribution, reflecting a drier year statewide.

- **Bar plot (Average Rainfall per Year):**  
  Indicates 2013 as the year with the highest average rainfall while 2014 is the driest among the four years. The intermediate years 2011 and 2012 fall between these extremes.

- **Line plot (Rainfall trend in districts like BHOPAL):**  
  Highlights fluctuations and trends in annual rainfall at the district level. Such trends could be valuable for understanding regional water resource availability and potential impacts of climatic changes.

Together, these findings present a detailed look into the rainfall dynamics across Madhya Pradesh over the study period, evidencing inter-annual and spatial variability important for agricultural planning and water management.
